ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. has been managing employee details using Excel files and manual records. 
As the company grows, this approach leads to confusion, data errors, and delays in salary processing.
 Managers find it difficult to track employee attendance, roles, and performance in one place. 
Generating reports for decision-making becomes time-consuming.
 To solve this, the company needs an SQL-based Employee Management System to manage employee data efficiently.
